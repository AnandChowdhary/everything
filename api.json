Furthermore, it's getting complicated to maintain documentations and say: To install this package, use npm install package or yarn add package, etc."

      "excerpt": "I think Twitter should have a concept of sub-accounts. It's not smart to create a Twitter account for every small project, but it's often a necessity for support or a social media presence. In my case, I have a Twitter account, and so does Oswald Labs (which makes complete sense since it's a company and I'm just a small part of it). However, I also have several other projects, like Made with Love in India, a platform to showcase Indian-made startups, which has its own Twitter account."

    "data": {
      "excerpt": "When I first started using Google Docs, my favorite feature was \"smart\" autosaving. \"Smart\" because it's not just an interval, but also based on content changes. Today, almost all popular web-based text editors have both autosaving (WordPress, Medium, etc.) and rich text formatting (think [f]CKEditor and TinyMCE a decade ago). The question is — how can I combine the rich text and autosaving aspects with git's version control, so I can smartly save only the changes to a file and easily go back."

That's right, in plain text. The problem with this method of password storage is that if anyone gets access to your database, they can literally just see the passwords. This is why hashing is used, which converts the plain text password to an encrypted \"hashed\" version that is, in an ideal world, undecryptable."

We wanted to create a platform where students and teachers can find each other. We soon moved to a platform where students can access good-quality study material for free. I am about to take my 12th grade board examinations next week, so over the past few weeks, I have been re-thinking the Class Rebels business model."
