Year of Gratitude is a little different from my previous themes, as it's not a goal I'm trying to achieve, but rather a mindset I want to cultivate. I want to be more grateful for the things I have, the people in my life, and the opportunities I've been given."

It's not smart to create a Twitter account for every small project, but it's often a necessity for support or a social media presence. In my case, I have a Twitter account, and so does Oswald Labs (which makes complete sense since it's a company and I'm just a small part of it). However, I also have several other projects, like Made with Love in India, a platform to showcase Indian-made startups, which has its own Twitter account."

      "excerpt": "When I first started using Google Docs, my favorite feature was \"smart\" autosaving. \"Smart\" because it's not just an interval, but also based on content changes. Today, almost all popular web-based text editors have both autosaving (WordPress, Medium, etc.) and rich text formatting (think [f]CKEditor and TinyMCE a decade ago). The question is — how can I combine the rich text and autosaving aspects with git's version control, so I can smartly save only the changes to a file and easily go back."

I switched from a Firefox/Opera combination to Chrome as my primary web browser when it was released in late 2008 because it was fast and secure. Today, I use Chrome because it's still standards-compliant and I'm very deep into the Google ecosystem."
