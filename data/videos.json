    "description": "In this episode of the Minimum Viable Podcast, my old friend Anand talks about his interior design startup: Koj and his role and responsibilities there.

    "description": "The World Bank estimates that 15% of the worldâ€™s population is affected by one disability or another. 2.68 crore Indians are differently abled, which is 2.21% of the population, so why isn't technology more accessible to the differently abled? This is exactly what CEO of Oswald Labs Anand Chaudhary set out to address when he founded his company to build new technologies that help people grow, through accessibility and equality. He caught up with Map of Me in Delhi to talk about the skills needed to be a young entrepreneur and how the best businesses solve problems."
